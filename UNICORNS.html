  <h1>UNICORNS!!!!!!!</h1>


  <h2>What is a Unicorn? </h2>

  <p>The unicorn is a legendary creature like a horse, but with a slender, usually spiral, horn growing out of its forehead. The popular image of the unicorn is that of a white horse differing only in the horn. But do not believe in these lies, THEY ARE ALL FALSE! Unicorns come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. So do not be unicorn-ist.</p>

  <h2>Unicorn horns </h2>

<p>In medieval lore, the spiraled horn of the unicorns was called the alicorn, and was thought to neutralize poisons. In popular mythology, unicorns were hunted for their horns, which were said to protect one against diseases, or, if made into a cup, would protect on eform any poison that might have been added to one's drink. This belief is derived from Ctesias' reports on the unicorn in India, where it was used by the rulers of that place for anti-toxin purposes so as to avoid assassination.People sold what they purported to be unicorn horns at this time, but were actually selling narwall horns (narwalls are whales possessed by unicorns who are actually the cousins of unicorns).</p>

<h2 class="small">Where Unicorns Originated From </h2>

<p>Traditionally, the unicorn had a billy-goat beard, a lion's tail, and choven hoofs. Ironically, this perception was more realistic, as only cloven-hoofed animals have horns. Unicorns were once thought of as nasty, easily provoked creatures, unlike the gentle perception we have of them today. They were thought to have deep, bellowing voices. As Ctesias, the ancient Greek physician, said:"The unicorn was native to India, the size of a donkey, with a burgundy head and white body; it had blue eyes, a single horn that was bright red at the top, black in the middle, and white at the bottom; the horn was also eighteen inches long."Julis Ceasar also described the unicorn, saying, "It had a deer's head, elephant's feet, a three-foot long horn, and a boar's tail." It was not until the middle ages that the unicorn began to take on its present form. Today when you hear about unicorns in books, movies, or mythology classes at military friendly colleges the image you picture is less frightening.</p>

<h2>What Do Unicorns Look Like? </h2>

<p> The Unicorn is truly a breath-taking animal as those lucky enough to have encountered one would tell you. It is taller than an average horse, eventually reaching the height of around two peds when fully grown. Its ragged yet magnificent mane and tail is always a translucent silver colour, which can shine so bright under the sun that it can be dangerous to look directly at the beast. The coat of a Unicorn can be in a range of colours, spanning through dark brown, jet-black, moonlight silver, dazzling gold, although commonly it is seen to be pure white. This is thought to be another representation of the purity of the Unicorn, linking it once again to the  elven  Injèrá. Rumours have told of beasts with red or blue coats, these have never been confirmed though, and many believe the possibility of this colouring to be non-existent.A Unicorn’s eyes are generally a sky blue, or a purple haze. Their hooves will match the colour of their eyes, and are solid in shape, leaving a distinct mark, but this is only seen on marshy land. It is rare to find the hoof mark of a Unicorn, for they tread very lightly, some even believe that they hover just above the ground, as they will leave few traces of their presence.The horn of the Unicorn is what truly gives the distinguished air and presence that it carries. Protruding from the forehead of the animal, it appears to have a spiral engraved upon it, which catches the sun and reflects the rays to the area around, giving the impression that the Unicorn has an ever-present aura or shield surrounding its form. The horn can be any colour, some people even believe that the animal can change the shade itself, reflecting the mood of the unicorn.</p>

<h2>Unicorn Magical Abilities </h2>

<p>The Unicorn is a highly intelligent creature, as one would expect from a creature of the Gods. Whilst one has never been caught and studied intensively, it is known that the eldest and wisest of the creatures are telepathic, and able to broadcast their thoughts and feelings to whomever they wish. Younger animals have a certain degree of empathy, being able to sense the emotions of people around them, and also able to communicate theirs. However, despite these abilities, what the Unicorn is truly known for is the amazing power of its horn. Supposed to be able to cure any illness instantly if taken into the body, many of the great beasts have died for the simple greed of the people of Caelereth. For, once the horn is taken, the beast will die almost immediately, robbed of its very identity by the hideous crime that has been committed to it. There are noted exceptions to this however. If a Unicorn judges a person in need to be worthy of its remarkable healing power, it will offer the tip of its horn to the sufferer. To have this happen is indeed a great honour. In this case, the beast will not die. The final astonishing ability as told in many legends is the power of the Unicorn's blood. For the blood of a Unicorn to be spilt means that something of great evil has happened to it. And so every drop of blood that touches the ground is deadly to whatever encounters the thick, scarlet liquid, should it be an ant on the ground, the grass beneath, or perhaps even a human which might have caused the death of the Unicorn. It is truly an irony for an animal so pure to harbour a weapon so deadly within the very essence of its form. </p>
