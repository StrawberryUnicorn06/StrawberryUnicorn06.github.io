  <h1>What are Narwhals?</h1>
  <p>Narwhals are the world's most magical creatures, besides unicorns. Hehe. The reason why narwhals have horns on their head, because there is actually a unicorn inside of the narwhal. NARWHALS ARE ACTUALLY WHALES POSSESSED BY UNICORNS! DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!! Unicorns where being hunted by evil humans, so they decided to take shelter inside of whales. But, the unicorns couldn't simply just get eaten by a whale and digested, but they instead took control of the whale.*gasp*</p>

  <h1>Narwhals' Cousin, the Unicorn</h1>
  <p>Unicorns are beautiful creatures that are worshiped in the Scotland, and United Kingdom. They are on the Scotland Flag and Coat of Arms I think. Yay. Unicorns come in all sizes, colors, and shapes. Do not be Unicornist. Do not believe in what those haters say. We do not all butt tattoos and golden horns. In reality, there are four types of unicorns. Earth Unicorns have no wings or horn. Which sort of confuzzles me becuase why are they still unicorns when they have no horn. The next type of unicorn is a pegasi. They do not have a horn, but contain a beautiful set of wings. They can either be feathered or scarely. There is also another type of unicorn called unihorn. They have amazing horns on their foreheads that can turn you into a pig. Alicorns are the unicorns from the royal family. They have both horns and wings, so they can kill people like Anna cause they make Bob feel bad.</p>
